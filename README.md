## Abstract

Both theory and experimental data from pathogens suggest that the production of transmission stages should be strongly associated with virulence, but the genetic bases of parasite transmission/virulence traits are poorly understood. The blood fluke *Schistosoma mansoni* shows extensive variation in numbers of cercariae larvae shed and in their virulence to infected snail hosts, consistent with expected trade-offs between parasite transmission and virulence. We crossed schistosomes from two populations that differ 8-fold in cercarial shedding and in their virulence to *Biomphalaria glabrata* snail hosts, and determined four-week cercarial shedding profiles in F0 parents, F1 parents and 376 F2 progeny from two independent crosses in inbred snails. Sequencing and linkage analysis revealed that cercarial production is polygenic and controlled by five QTLs. These QTLs act additively, explaining 28.56% of the phenotypic variation. These results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of key traits relevant to schistosome ecology can be dissected using classical linkage mapping approaches.

## Code

The code used to analyze the data presented in the mansucript is available in this repository.

## Prerequisites

Two dependencies must be installed before running the Jupyter notebook:
* A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) distribution, like [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) with a [bash kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel).

Once this is done, run the first cell of the Jupyter notebook from this repository to install a dedicated conda environment and related R packages.
